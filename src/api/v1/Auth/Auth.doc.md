# 🚀 GDG Ranchi Auth System (FAANG-Level Architecture)

> This document defines the **complete Authentication + Identity + Role + Security system** for CommDesk.
> It is designed to be **production-ready, scalable, multi-tenant, and enterprise-grade**.

---

# 🧠 Core Philosophy

```text
Auth = Security + Identity
User = Global Identity
Member = Community Context
Role = Behavior inside community
BuilderProfile = Developer Identity
BuilderStats = Reputation Engine
```

---

# 🏗️ System Architecture

```text
Auth
 ↓
User
 ↓
Member
 ↓
Role Layer (Organizer / Mentor / Judge / Participant)
 ↓
Permission Layer
 ↓
BuilderProfile (participants only)
 ↓
BuilderStats (async reputation)
```

# 📦 Modules Overview

```text
/api/v1
 ├── auth
 ├── user
 ├── member
 ├── organization
 ├── permission
 ├── audit
 ├── builder
```

# 🔐 Auth Schema (Security Core)

## Fields

- email
- passwordHash
- emailVerified
- systemRole
- failedLoginAttempts
- loginAttemptsWindow
- banExpiresAt
- isBanned
- refreshTokens[]
- deviceSessions[]
- mfaEnabled
- userId

---

## ✅ TODO (Auth Schema)

- [ ] Add refresh token rotation support
- [ ] Add device session tracking
- [ ] Add MFA (TOTP)
- [ ] Add login anomaly detection
- [ ] Add token blacklist system

---

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Member Creation

# 🚀 Endpoint

```http
POST /api/v1/members
```

# 🧠 Purpose

Create a **new member inside a community** with:

- role assignment (Mentor / Judge / Organizer / Participant)
- onboarding (activation-based, no password yet)
- optional user + auth creation
- audit + security logging

---

# 📥 Request Body

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "primaryRole": "MENTOR",
  "location": "Berlin",
  "skills": ["React", "Node"],
  "areaOfInterest": ["MENTORSHIP"],
  "internalNotes": "Speaker for React workshops",
  "accessLevel": {
    "internalDashboard": true,
    "comunityForum": true,
    "adminControls": false,
    "superAdmin": false
  }
}
```

---

# 🔍 FIELD VALIDATION (STRICT)

---

## Required Fields

- `firstName` → string (min 2, trim)
- `lastName` → string (min 2, trim)
- `email` → valid email (lowercase, unique globally)
- `primaryRole` → enum

```ts
"PARTICIPANT" | "MENTOR" | "JUDGE" | "ORGANIZER";
```

---

## Optional Fields

- `location` → string
- `skills[]` → max 20 strings
- `areaOfInterest[]` → enum values
- `internalNotes` → max 500 chars
- `accessLevel` → object (default false)

---

## AccessLevel Defaults

```ts
{
  internalDashboard: false,
  comunityForum: true,
  adminControls: false,
  superAdmin: false
}
```

---

# ⚠️ PRE-CONDITIONS (MUST PASS)

---

## 1. 🔐 Authentication

- requester must be logged in
- extract `userId` from JWT

---

## 2. 🏢 Community Context

- `communityId` must be resolved from:
  - route param OR
  - auth context

---

## 3. 🔑 Authorization

Only allow if:

```txt
role = ORGANIZER OR permission = MANAGE_MEMBERS
```

---

## 4. 🚫 Duplicate Check

```ts
Member.findOne({ email, communityId });
```

👉 If exists → reject

---

# 🔥 CORE FLOW (STEP BY STEP)

---

## 🟢 STEP 1: Validate Input

- validate via Zod
- sanitize all strings

---

## 🟢 STEP 2: Resolve User

```ts
let user = await User.findOne({ email });
```

---

### CASE A: User EXISTS

✔ reuse existing `userId`

---

### CASE B: User DOES NOT EXIST

```txt
create User
create Auth (inactive)
```

Auth state:

```ts
{
  email,
  passwordHash: null,
  emailVerified: false,
  activationToken: generated
}
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 3: Create Member

```ts
Member.create({
  userId,
  communityId,

  firstName,
  lastName,
  email,

  primaryRole,

  location,
  skills,
  areaOfInterest,

  internalNotes,
  accessLevel,

  membershipStatus: "ON_BOARDING",

  invitedBy: requesterId,
});
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 4: Role-Specific Hook

---

### PARTICIPANT

- create `BuilderProfile`
- create empty `BuilderStats`

---

### MENTOR

- create `MentorMeta`

---

### JUDGE

- create `JudgeMeta`

---

### ORGANIZER

- create `OrganizerMeta`

---

## 🟢 STEP 5: Generate Activation Token

```ts
crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
```

Store in Auth:

```ts
activationToken;
emailVerificationToken;
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 6: Send Onboarding Email

Email contains:

```txt
https://commdesk.app/activate?token=xyz
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 7: Audit Log

```ts
AuditLog.create({
  actorId: requesterId,
  action: "MEMBER_CREATED",
  metadata: { email, role },
});
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 8: Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Member invited successfully",
  "data": {
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "status": "ON_BOARDING"
  }
}
```

---

# 🔐 AUTH CONNECTION (IMPORTANT)

---

## When Member is created

Auth:

```ts
{
  email,
  passwordHash: null,
  activationToken,
  emailVerified: false
}
```

---

## Activation Flow (later)

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/activate-member
```

---

# ⚡ EDGE CASES

---

## Case 1: User exists globally

✔ reuse
❌ do NOT create new Auth

---

## Case 2: User exists in another community

✔ allow
✔ create new Member

---

## Case 3: Already member in same community

❌ reject

---

# 🛡️ SECURITY RULES

---

- only authorized users can create members
- never expose `internalNotes` publicly
- never send password via email
- always hash tokens before storing

---

# 📊 STATUS FLOW

```txt
ON_BOARDING → ACTIVE → SUSPENDED → BANNED
```

---

# ⚡ PERFORMANCE NOTES

---

- index on `(email, communityId)`
- index on `userId`
- avoid duplicate queries

---

# 📦 FINAL DATA FLOW

 ↓
Validate
 ↓
Check User
 ↓
Create User/Auth (if needed)

# 📌 Notes

- The creator automatically becomes the **Owner** of the community.
- The owner is automatically added to the community members list.
- A unique, SEO-friendly slug is generated using the community name and a UUID.
- If a logo file is uploaded, it is stored in Cloudinary.
- If no logo is uploaded, the API uses the provided `LogoUrl`, or falls back to a default placeholder image.
- Newly registered communities remain in **Pending** status until reviewed or approved by the platform administrators.
- Organization-specific permissions are automatically assigned after successful registration.

---

# 🔥 CREATION FLOW (STEP BY STEP)

---

## 🟢 STEP 1: Normalize Data

- lowercase username
- normalize skills

---

## 🟢 STEP 2: Create BuilderStats (EMPTY)

```ts
BuilderStats.create({
  userId,
  hackathonsJoined: 0,
  projectsSubmitted: 0,
  wins: 0,
  reputationPoints: 0,
});
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 3: Create BuilderProfile

```ts
BuilderProfile.create({
  userId,
  communityId: null,

  username,
  fullName,
  bio,
  location,

  university,
  degree,
  graduationYear,
  experienceLevel,

  githubUrl,
  linkedinUrl,
  portfolioUrl,

  skills,
  preferredTracks,

  openToTeamInvite,
  openToHiring,

  visibility,

  builderStatsId,
});
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 4: Waitlist Entry (OPTIONAL)

👉 For upcoming events / early access

---

## 🟢 STEP 5: Audit Log

```ts
AuditLog.create({
  action: "BUILDER_PROFILE_CREATED",
  actorId: userId,
});
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 6: Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Builder profile created",
  "data": {
    "username": "abhishek-dev"
  }
}
```

---

# 🔄 LIFECYCLE INTEGRATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

---

## 1. Discover

- search via:
  - skills
  - reputation
  - visibility

---

## 2. Apply

- join event
- create WaitlistEntry

---

## 3. Join Team

- use `openToTeamInvite`
- match via skills

---

## 4. Build

- linked to project system

---

## 5. Submit

- increment:

```ts
projectsSubmitted++;
```

---

## 6. Get Judged

- update:

```ts
averageScore;
```

---

## 7. Earn Reputation

```ts
reputationPoints += score;
wins++;
```

---

## 8. Get Hired

- filter:

```ts
openToHiring === true;
visibility === "Public";
```

---

# ⚡ PERFORMANCE DESIGN

---

## Indexes

- username (unique)
- userId
- skills[]
- reputationPoints

---

# 🛡️ SECURITY RULES

---

- cannot edit another user's profile
- sanitize bio input
- validate URLs
- prevent script injection

---

# 🏁 Conclusion

This Auth system is not just authentication.

It is:
